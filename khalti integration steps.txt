search khalti docs in google

-----------
inside clientIntegration >"web SDK" you will see a section describing about how you will "install with build tools"
ie. you will see a section like 
using yarn 
  yarn add khalti-checkout-web
using npkm 
  npm install khalti-checkout-web --save
=> copy npm i command and install the dependency 
---------


copy config object from that doc>client integration>web sdk> under "Install with build tools" title and 
and paste in config.

now see what extra codes i did on khalti.js and khalticonfig.js and khaltikey.js file.

check by putting khalti ph no and pin and verify otp and hitting submit.if you get object in console.log after submitting you khalti ph no and pin,
then assume that your client side integration is complete



===server side integration===
go to khalti docs>server side integration > verification  and you will find integration code for node js.
copy it and paste in KhaltiConfig.js file 
dont forget to replace dummy token to  "payload.token" and dummy amount to "payload.amount" & 
      let config = {
        headers: {
          Authorization:"dummy authorization key" to myKey.secretKey
        },
      };
